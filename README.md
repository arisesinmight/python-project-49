Hexlet brain games project contains different logical games:


   is_even: In wich you should answer if random number is even
   
   calculator: In wich you should solve random arithmetical expressions
   
   nod: In wich you should find out the greatest common divisor of two random numbers
   
   progression: In wich you should find out the missing part of random arithmetical progression
   
   is prime: In wich you should answer if random number is prime

Programm runs on UNIX and MAC systems, to run on Windows use WSL

To install:
Clone repository and being in its root(python-project-49) run "make install-package", or if you don't use "make" utility, run "python3 -m pip install --user dist/*.whl". You will still need to have "python 3" and "pip" to be installed in your system.
    

To run games use:


brain-even 

brain-calc 

brain-nod 

brain-progression 

brain-prime
